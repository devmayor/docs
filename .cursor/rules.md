## Core writing principles

### Language and style requirements

### Content organization standards

- Lead with the most important information (inverted pyramid structure)

- Break complex procedures into numbered steps
- Include prerequisites and context before instructions
- Provide expected outcomes for each major step
- Use descriptive, keyword-rich headings for navigation and SEO
- Group related information logically with clear section breaks

### User-centered approach
