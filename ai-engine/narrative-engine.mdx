Use AI to convert tweets into narrative signals that map to new token launches.

### How it works

1. Select high‑signal tweeter handles in the tweeter handle into a unique tag e.g elon musk, donald trump
2. The AI extracts themes and keywords from there tweets
3. The system watches for new tokens whose name/symbol matches AI‑identified narratives
4. Your strategy triggers when matches occur
