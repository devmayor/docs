description: "Leverage AI to detect emerging narratives and front‑run launches."
---

Use AI to convert author streams into narrative signals that map to new token launches.

### How it works

1. Select high‑signal authors in the Author Hub
2. AI extracts themes and keywords from tweets
3. The system watches for new tokens whose name/symbol matches AI‑identified narratives
4. Your strategy triggers when matches occur
