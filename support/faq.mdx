* **Is my wallet secure when I connect to MemeTrader?**
  * Yes. We use SIWE (Sign‑In with Wallet). You sign a message to prove ownership; it's not a transaction and can't move funds.

* **How fast are the alerts?**
  * The backend is event‑driven for near‑instant processing. On‑chain events typically alert within seconds.

* **What chains do you support?**
  * Initial focus: Solana. Expansion planned for Base, Ethereum, Polygon.

* **Can I cancel my Pro subscription at any time?**
  * Yes. Manage from Settings. If you cancel, access continues until the end of the billing period.

* **How does the AI Narrative Engine work?**
  * We monitor selected authors, extract themes via LLM, then watch for new tokens matching those narratives to trigger your strategy.
