* **What is MemePerfect?**
  * MemePerfect is an advanced platform for all traders. It goes beyond simple alerts by giving you a powerful Strategy Editor to build, test, and automate your own unique alpha. We combine real‑time on‑chain data, social sentiment, and smart‑money tracking to send highly qualified, custom alerts to your Telegram.

* **Who is MemePerfect for?**
  * Beginners can start in minutes using pre‑built templates ("Max Safety", "Balanced Risk").
  * Experienced traders can use the Strategy Editor to create deeply customized, multi‑layered strategies with complex AND/OR logic.

* **What are Strategies and how do they work?**
  * Triggers: The event that starts analysis (e.g., new token created, followed wallet buys).
  * Dealbreakers: Non‑negotiable safety checks (e.g., Is Honeypot is False). If any fail, analysis stops.
  * Rule Groups: Nuanced logic using MATCH ALL (AND) and MATCH ANY (OR). Use multiple groups for safety, momentum, and social proof.

* **What is the Strategy Simulator (Backtesting)?**
  * Test your strategy against historical launches to see alert counts, winners, and rugs. Use results to refine logic before going live.

* **How does MemePerfect find promising tokens ("gems")?**
  * 1. Strategy Engine: Build complete logic across contract security, market metrics, and holder behavior. Not just filters—full strategies.
  * 2. Alpha Engine: Discover top traders and successful devs, then trigger when these proven wallets make a move.
  * 3. AI Narrative Engine: Track high‑signal authors in real time; get alerted when new tokens match emerging narratives.

* **How does MemePerfect track Twitter/X activity?**
  * Direct Mention Alerts: Trigger on cashtag or contract mentions from your managed author list.
  * AI Narrative Alerts: Watch selected authors; AI identifies themes and alerts when new tokens match those narratives.

* **How does the AI Narrative Engine work?**
  * We monitor selected authors, extract themes via LLM, then watch for new tokens matching those narratives to trigger your strategy.

* **Can MemePerfect automate my trading?**
  * No. We will never request private keys or control your funds. We are an intelligence and alerting engine. Alerts include deep links to popular trading tools (e.g., BananaGun, Unibot, BonkBot) with the token prefilled, but execution is always your decision.

* **How fast are the alerts?**
  * Event‑driven backend; on‑chain events typically alert within seconds.

* **What chains do you support?**
  * Initial focus: Solana. Expansion to additional chains is planned.

* **Is there a refund policy?**
  * Yes. Full 3‑day refund on initial subscriptions (monthly/quarterly). Weekly plans and renewals are non‑refundable. Contact support via Telegram within 3 days to request a refund.

* **Is MemePerfect safe and is this financial advice?**
  * MemePerfect is a powerful analytical tool, not financial advice. Trading crypto—especially new tokens—carries significant risk. Always DYOR, manage risk, and never trade more than you can afford to lose. You remain in control of your wallet at all times.
