## Understanding Rule Types

### Boolean Rules
Rules that check for the presence or absence of a condition. Use "is" operator to set whether the condition should be true or false.

**Example:** "Exclude Honeypots" - Set to "is true" to exclude honeypot tokens.

### Number Rules
Rules that compare numeric values. Use "greater than" or "less than" operators with a threshold value.

**Example:** "Liquidity ($)" - Set "greater than $10,000" to require minimum liquidity.

### Percentage Rules
Rules that compare percentage values. Use "greater than" or "less than" operators with a percentage threshold.

**Example:** "Sell Tax %" - Set "less than 10%" to exclude tokens with high sell taxes.

### String/Enum Rules
Rules with predefined options. Use "equals" or "does not equal" operators with a specific value.

**Example:** "Risk Level" - Set "does not equal CRITICAL" to exclude high-risk tokens.
