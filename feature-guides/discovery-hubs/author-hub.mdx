The quality of Twitter-based strategies depends on source quality. The Author Hub is your command center for discovering, managing, and organizing accounts you want to monitor.

Instead of adding handles one-by-one inside the Strategy Editor, manage a central, reusable library here.

### Core features

- **Centralized management**: View all tracked authors and toggle Active/Inactive.
- **Search & Filter**: Find authors instantly.
- **Tags**: Group authors for reusable, precise lists.

### Tags in practice

Create two strategies using tags:

1. "degen" strategy listening to high-risk meme accounts
2. "serious" strategy listening to respected devs/analysts

Assign tags like `narrative-king`, `serious-alpha`, `degen-plays`, then select those tags in the "Tweet Mentions a Token" trigger.

<Tip>
Use small, focused tag sets. Precision beats volume.
