The Strategy Editor turns your insights into an automated, 24/7 alpha‑hunting machine. It's a simple 4‑step wizard.

#### Step 1: Details — Naming & Data Policy
<Frame caption="Step 1 settings">
  <img src="/images/details.png" alt="Strategy editor step 1" />
</Frame>
- Name your strategy clearly (e.g., "High‑Volume Breakout Screener").
- Data Handling Policy:
  - **Data Strictness (ON)**: Wait for critical data; fail if missing (safest).
  - **Data Strictness (OFF)**: Proceed and skip missing data (degenerate mode—use with caution).

</Frame>

#### Step 2: Triggers — Defining "When"

Combine different trigger types. Example: "New Token Created" AND "A tweet mentions a token" to apply the same safety rules to both.

#### Step 3: Rules — Defining "What"

Rules are the conditions that tokens must meet to generate an alert. Once a trigger fires, rules evaluate the token's properties, on-chain data, and social signals.

#### Rule Categories

Rules are organized into four categories, each focusing on different aspects of token evaluation:

**Security**

Security rules protect you from scams and risky tokens. These rules check for:

- **Honeypots**: Tokens that prevent selling after purchase
- **Rugged Tokens**: Tokens that have been previously scammed

- **Risk Levels**: Overall security risk assessment (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- **Token Mutability**: Whether token properties can be changed
- **Creator History**: Whether the creator has a history of rug pulls
- **Ownership Concentration**: Risk from single holders or top 10 holders
- **Transfer Fees**: Additional fees on transactions
- **Token Age**: How long the token has existed

**Available Security Rules:**

- Exclude Honeypots: Filters tokens that trap buyers
- Require LP Locked: Ensures liquidity is locked
- Exclude Rugged Tokens: Skips tokens with rug history
- Exclude Tokens With Freeze Authority: Prevents frozen token attacks
- Exclude Single Holder Dominance: Filters tokens with excessive single holder control 
- Exclude Low LP Providers: Filters tokens with insufficient liquidity providers

- Exclude Creator Balance: Filters tokens where creator holds too much supply
- Risk Count: Sets bounds on risk indicators (Min/Max)
- Exclude Transfer Fee: Filters tokens with transfer fees
- Exclude Mintable Tokens: Blocks tokens that can mint new supply
- Risk Level: Categorizes tokens by risk assessment (dropdown: Any, CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- LP Locked %: Requires specific percentage of liquidity locked (Min/Max)

#### Flexible Matching

By default, your strategy requires tokens to meet **ALL** of your configured rules. Flexible Matching allows you to be more flexible by accepting tokens that meet a **percentage** of your criteria instead of requiring every single condition.

**How to Enable Flexible Matching:**
<Frame caption="Flexible Matching">
  <img src="/images/flexible-matching.png" alt="Enable flexible matching" />
</Frame>

1. Locate the **"Flexible Matching"** card at the top of the Rules step
2. Check the **"Enable"** checkbox in the top-right corner of the card
3. The Match Threshold slider will become active

**Match Threshold:**

Once enabled, you can adjust the **Match Threshold** using the slider:

<Frame caption="Adjusting Match Threshold slider">
  <img src="/images/flexible-matching-working.gif" alt="Animation showing how to adjust the Match Threshold slider in Flexible Matching" />
</Frame>

- **Range**: 0% to 100%
- **Default**: 80%
- **How it works**: 
  - Set to **100%**: Tokens must meet ALL rules (same as disabled)
  - Set to **80%**: Tokens must meet at least 80% of your rules
  - Set to **50%**: Tokens must meet at least half of your rules
  - Set to **0%**: Any token will match (not recommended)

**Example:**

If you have 10 rules configured and set Match Threshold to 80%:

- A token needs to pass at least 8 out of 10 rules to match your strategy
- This allows for tokens that are mostly good but might fail one or two non-critical conditions

#### Dealbreakers

Dealbreakers are rules that **must always be met**, regardless of your Match Threshold setting. When Flexible Matching is enabled, you can mark specific rules as dealbreakers to ensure certain critical conditions are never bypassed.

**How to Mark a Rule as a Dealbreaker:**

1. **Enable Flexible Matching** first (dealbreaker switches only appear when Flexible Matching is on)
2. For each rule you want to make mandatory, toggle the **dealbreaker switch** (appears to the left of the rule name)
3. When a rule is marked as a dealbreaker:
   - It shows as enabled (switch is on)
   - The rule will **always** be required, even if Match Threshold is set below 100%
   - It is not counted in the percentage calculation for other rules

**When to Use Dealbreakers:**

Use dealbreakers for **critical safety rules** that should never be compromised:

**Good Dealbreaker Candidates:**

- ✅ Exclude Honeypots
- ✅ Exclude Rugged Tokens
- ✅ Exclude Tokens With Freeze Authority
- ✅ Risk Level: Not CRITICAL or HIGH
- ✅ Exclude Creator Rug History

**Rules That Can Be Flexible:**

- Market Cap ranges (can vary)
- Trading volume (fluctuates)
- Social media presence (nice to have, not critical)
- Holder counts (can grow over time)

**How Dealbreakers Work with Match Threshold:**

**Example Scenario:**

- You have 10 total rules configured
- 3 rules are marked as dealbreakers (Exclude Honeypots, Exclude Rugged Tokens, Risk Level)
- Match Threshold is set to 70%

**How it works:**

1. **First**: All 3 dealbreakers must pass (100% required)
2. **Then**: From the remaining 7 non-dealbreaker rules, at least 70% must pass (5 out of 7 rules)
3. **Result**: Token must pass all 3 dealbreakers + at least 5 of the 7 flexible rules

This ensures critical safety while allowing flexibility on less important criteria.

##### Using the Interface

**Category Tabs:**

- Click any category tab (Security, Market, Socials, AI) to view rules in that category
- Each tab shows a **badge count** indicating how many rules you've configured in that category
- The active tab is highlighted in blue

**Configuring Rules:**

1. **Boolean Rules**: Simply check the checkbox to enable the rule
2. **Range Rules**: Enter values in the Min and/or Max fields
3. **Enum Rules**: Select a value from the dropdown (default is "Any")

**Clearing Rules:**

- Click the **"Clear"** button in the top-right of any category tab to remove all configured rules in that category
- This only clears the current category, not all categories

**Information Tooltips:**

- Hover over the **ℹ️** icon next to any rule to see a detailed description
- This helps you understand what each rule checks

**Rule Validation:**

- Range rules validate that Min < Max
- All numeric values must be positive
- Invalid configurations show error messages in red

<Tip>
Hover a rule to read its definition and impact before adding.

#### Best Practices

**Starting Out:**

1. **Begin with Security rules**: Protect yourself first
2. **Add Market rules**: Set reasonable liquidity and volume thresholds
3. **Include Social rules**: Ensure tokens have community presence
4. **Review and refine**: Test your strategy and adjust based on results

**Using Flexible Matching:**

- **Start conservative**: Use 80-90% Match Threshold initially
- **Mark critical rules as dealbreakers**: Never compromise on safety
- **Lower threshold gradually**: If you're missing good opportunities, lower to 70-75%
- **Monitor results**: Track which rules are failing most often

**Rule Selection Tips:**

- **Security**: Always exclude honeypots and rugged tokens (make these dealbreakers)
- **Market**: Set minimum liquidity ($10K+) and reasonable market cap ranges
- **Socials**: Require at least one social media presence
- **Balance**: Don't set too many restrictive rules, or you'll miss opportunities

**Advanced Mode:**

If you need more control, you can switch to **Advanced Mode** using the checkbox in the header. Advanced Mode allows you to:

- Create custom rule groups with AND/OR logic
- Configure more complex rule combinations
- Fine-tune operators and values

<Warning>
Switching from Advanced to Basic Mode may result in data loss if you've used features not available in Basic Mode.
</Warning>
