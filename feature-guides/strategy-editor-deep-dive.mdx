The Strategy Editor turns your insights into an automated, 24/7 alpha‑hunting machine. It's a simple 4‑step wizard.

#### Step 1: Details — Naming & Data Policy

- Name your strategy clearly (e.g., "High‑Volume Breakout Screener").
- Data Handling Policy:
  - **Data Strictness (ON)**: Wait for critical data; fail if missing (safest).
  - **Data Strictness (OFF)**: Proceed and skip missing data (degenerate mode—use with caution).

#### Step 2: Triggers — Defining "When"

Combine different trigger types. Example: "New Token Created" AND "Token Enters Dextools Trending" to apply the same safety rules to both.

#### Step 3: Rules — Defining "What"

- Start with **Dealbreakers**.
- Use **MATCH ALL** groups for core criteria.
- Use **MATCH ANY** groups for flexible signals.
- Leverage the **Rule Selector Drawer**: search, filter, and hover for definitions.

<Tip>
Hover a rule to read its definition and impact before adding.
</Tip>

#### Step 4: Review — Confirm and Activate

Confirm Triggers and Rules. Save, optionally activate immediately. Your engine goes live.
