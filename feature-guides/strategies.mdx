The Strategies page is your central command center. Create, edit, activate, and analyze performance across all your alpha engines.

### Strategy Card anatomy

1. **Configuration Summary**: Active triggers, rule counts, and data policy.
2. **Performance Insights (Pro)**: Alerts fired, historical success rate, total realized P&L.
3. **Actions**: Activate/Pause, Edit, Clone, Share, Performance Report.

### Optimize with the Performance Report

Use the report to iterate quickly:

- **Winning & Losing Trades**: See what worked.
- **Missed Opportunities**: Tokens that failed on one ruleâ€”tighten or relax accordingly.

<Tip>
Review "Missed Opportunities" weekly. It's the fastest path to higher precision/recall.
