Not all opportunities happen at launch. Some of the best trades appear days or weeks later. The search tokens runs on a schedule and finds tokens that currently match your filters.

### How it works

1. Build your filter in the search tokens
2. Set a schedule (1HR to daily)
3. Link it in a strategy with the `A Token Matches a Search Token filter` trigger

### Example: Weekly Breakout

Run every 4 hours with filters:

- Token Age (Days) is greater than 7
- Market Cap (USD) is between $50,000 and $500,000
- Volume (24h) is greater than $100,000
- Price Change (24h %) is greater than 25

When it finds a match, the token flows into your strategy for deep safety and quality checks.
