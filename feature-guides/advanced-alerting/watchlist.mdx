title: "The Watchlist: Watch, Then Pounce"
description: "Hold interesting tokens and alert when real momentum appears."

Use the Watchlist when a token looks promising but needs proof of traction.

1. Add to Watchlist from any entry alert (`[👁️ Add to Watchlist]`)
2. Define your global **Momentum Strategy** (what "real traction" means)
3. Receive a `[🔥 Momentum Alert]` when criteria are met

#### What makes a good momentum strategy?

Focus on rate of change:

- Telegram Member Growth (1h) is greater than 50%
- Social Velocity (% Change) is greater than 300%
- Holder Growth (4h) is greater than 100%
- Message Velocity (Messages/Min) is greater than 50

This turns See Alert → Research → Decide into an automated, two‑step workflow.
