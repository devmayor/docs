Finding an entry is half the battle. Position Tracking & Exit Strategies help you manage trades with discipline.

Once the system detects you've entered a trade (from an alert), it appears in the **Positions** dashboard. Attach an Exit Strategy to automate risk management.

#### Key exit triggers

- **P&L Hits Target**: Take profit at +200% or stop loss at -25%
- **Trailing Stop Loss (Pro)**: e.g., 15% trail from peak since entry
- **Dev Wallet Activity**: Exit if dev unlocks LP or starts dumping

<Tip>
Trailing stops let winners run while protecting against reversals.
