At its heart, MemePerfect constantly asks: "Does this token match my criteria?" A Strategy is your answer. It's the set of instructions that defines what opportunities you want to find.

Every strategy is built from two building blocks: **Triggers** and **Rules**.

`Trigger (When to look) + Rules (What to look for) = Action (Alert)`

<Frame caption="From events to alerts">
<img src="/images/hero-dark.png" alt="Funnel: Events → Triggers → Rules → Alert" />
</Frame>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Triggers" icon="bolt" href="/core-concepts/triggers-vs-rules">
    Define when the engine should wake up and analyze.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rules" icon="list-check" href="/core-concepts/rule-groups">
    Define what must be true for an alert to fire.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
Master this mental model. Most strategy issues are either the wrong Trigger (timing) or the wrong Rules (quality).
