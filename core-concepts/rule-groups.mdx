title: "Understanding Rules and Rule Groups (AND/OR Logic)"
description: "Combine conditions with MATCH ALL and MATCH ANY for precision."

If a token passes all Dealbreakers, it moves to Rule Groups. This is where nuance lives.

Rule Groups let you combine multiple conditions with AND/OR logic.

#### MATCH ALL (AND)

All rules in the group must be true.

Example: "Developer Legitimacy"

- Contract Renounced is True
- AND Creator Rug History is False
- AND LP Locked is True

#### MATCH ANY (OR)

At least one rule in the group must be true.

Example: "Early Momentum"

- Liquidity (USD) is greater than $10,000
- OR Social Volume (1h) is greater than 100
- OR Followed Wallet Holder Count is greater than 0

You can combine multiple groups. Tokens must pass Group 1 AND Group 2 AND Group 3.

### Combining Groups for Ultimate Precision

Think of each Rule Group as its own checklist. A token must pass every checklist to qualify. This separation lets you tune safety, quality, and momentum independently without rebuilding your logic.

#### Complete Example: "Safe Momentum" Alert

For a token to trigger this alert, it must pass all four groups below:

1. **Basic Safety Checklist (MATCH ALL)**
   - Is Honeypot is False
   - AND Sell Tax (%) is less than 10

2. **Developer Trust Checklist (MATCH ALL)**
   - Creator Rug History is False
   - AND LP Locked is True

3. **Early On-Chain Momentum (MATCH ANY)**
   - Initial Buy Pressure (%) is greater than 80
   - OR Liquidity (USD) is greater than $25,000

4. **Smart Money & Social Proof (MATCH ANY)**
   - Followed Wallet Holder Count is greater than 0
   - OR Social Volume (15m) is greater than 50

This design enforces safety and dev trust, while allowing either on‑chain momentum or social validation to qualify the opportunity.
