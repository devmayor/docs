title: "The Power of Rule Groups (AND/OR Logic)"
description: "Combine conditions with MATCH ALL and MATCH ANY for precision."

If a token passes all Dealbreakers, it moves to Rule Groups. This is where nuance lives.

Rule Groups let you combine multiple conditions with AND/OR logic.

#### MATCH ALL (AND)

All rules in the group must be true.

Example: "Developer Legitimacy"

- Contract Renounced is True
- AND Creator Rug History is False
- AND LP Locked is True

#### MATCH ANY (OR)

At least one rule in the group must be true.

Example: "Early Momentum"

- Liquidity (USD) is greater than $10,000
- OR Social Volume (1h) is greater than 100
- OR Followed Wallet Holder Count is greater than 0

You can combine multiple groups. Tokens must pass Group 1 AND Group 2 AND Group 3.
