It's essential to understand the difference between a Trigger and a Rule.

#### Triggers: The "When"

A Trigger is the event that says: wake up and analyze now. Your strategy runs only when an event matches one of your triggers.

- **Event-driven:**
  - A New Token is Created
  - A Tweet Mentions a Token
  - A Followed Dev Deploys a New Token

- **State-driven:**
  - A Token Matches a Screener (e.g., 7 days old and crosses $1M market cap)

A strategy can have multiple triggers. It runs if ANY of them fire.

#### Rules: The "What"

Rules are the conditions that must be true about the token when analysis runs. See Dealbreakers and Rule Groups for structure and logic.
