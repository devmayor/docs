Excellent. This is the perfect next step. A great product can fail without great documentation. It‚Äôs the key to user activation, retention, and reducing support load. Your approach of planning the entire structure first is exactly right.

The philosophy behind this documentation will be: **"Guide, Don't Overwhelm."** We will structure it like a journey, allowing a brand new user to start with the basics and progressively "level up" to the most advanced features at their own pace. It will be highly visual, scannable, and focused on outcomes.

---

### **Clarifying Questions**

Before I generate the full plan, I have just three quick questions to ensure the output is perfectly tailored to your needs:

1.  **Hosting Platform:** Where do you envision this documentation living? (e.g., on a dedicated platform like **GitBook**, **ReadMe.io**, integrated into your website with a tool like **Docusaurus**, or simply as a section within the main app?) This will influence the structural suggestions.

2.  **Primary Initial Audience:** While it should serve everyone, who is the most important user to get right on day one? Should the tone and initial examples be geared more towards the **Beginner/Intermediate** user who needs concepts explained, or the **Advanced Degen/Pro** user who just wants to know what your specific tools can do?

3.  **Priority Section:** Is there one specific feature (e.g., the Strategy Editor, the AI Narrative Engine) that you feel is the most complex or powerful, which you'd like the documentation to explain with extra care and detail?

---

Assuming the most common answers (a GitBook-style platform, targeting the Beginner-to-Intermediate user first, with a focus on the Strategy Editor), here is the full, proposed documentation plan.

**‚û°Ô∏è Next: [Quick Start Guide](./getting-started/quick-start-guide)**
Excellent. Let's move on to the most critical "first impression" page: the Quick Start Guide. This page is designed for the user who wants to see value *immediately*. It's all about speed and getting them to that "aha!" moment as quickly as possible.

---

### **Section 2 of 10: Getting Started**

**(Page: Quick Start Guide - 5 Minutes to Your First Alert)**

**Title:** ## Quick Start: 5 Minutes to Your First Alert

This guide is for traders who want to get up and running *now*. We'll skip the deep theory and get you set up to receive your first high-signal alert in the next five minutes.

**[Placeholder for a fast-paced, 1-minute GIF video: Shows the entire 3-step process below in a quick loop - connect wallet, clone template, link Telegram.]**

### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

Your secure, anonymous account is created by signing a message with your wallet. We never ask for your private keys or transaction approvals.

1.  Navigate to the **[MemeTrader App](https://app.memetrader.ai)**.
2.  Click the **`Connect Wallet`** button in the top-right corner.
3.  Choose your wallet provider (e.g., Phantom, MetaMask).
4.  Approve the connection and sign the login message when prompted.

You're in. Your dashboard is now active.

**[Placeholder for an image: A screenshot showing the main dashboard with an arrow pointing to the "Connect Wallet" button.]**

### Step 2: Clone a "Safe Launch" Strategy

You can build incredibly complex strategies, but let's start with a battle-tested template. The "Safe Launch Sniper" is designed to filter out 99% of common scams and low-effort launches.

1.  On your dashboard, click the **`+ Create New Strategy`** button.
2.  A modal will appear. Select the **"Fort Knox (Max Safety)"** template. This template is pre-configured with essential Dealbreakers like checking for honeypots and high taxes.
3.  The Strategy Editor will open, pre-filled with the template's rules. For now, you don't need to change anything. Just give it a name like "My First Sniper."
4.  Click **`Save Strategy`**.
5.  You'll be taken back to your dashboard. Find your new strategy card and click the **`Activate`** button. The status badge will turn green.

Your first alpha engine is now live and monitoring the market.

**[Placeholder for an image: A screenshot of the "Template Selector" modal with the "Fort Knox" template highlighted.]**

### Step 3: Link Your Telegram to Receive Alerts

This is the final step. Let's connect the engine to your phone.

1.  Navigate to the **`Settings`** page from the sidebar.
2.  You'll see the "Notification Channels" card. Click **`Generate Link Code`**. A unique, 6-digit code will appear.
3.  Open Telegram and start a chat with our official bot: **[@MemeTraderBot](https://t.me/MemeTraderBot)**.
4.  Send the bot the following command, replacing `123-456` with your unique code:
    `/link 123-456`
5.  The bot will confirm the connection. The card on the web dashboard will automatically update to show "Connected."

**[Placeholder for an image: A screenshot of the Settings page showing the "Generate Link Code" button and a an example code.]**

### That's It. You're Ready.

Your system is now fully configured. The "My First Sniper" strategy is actively scanning for new tokens that meet its safety criteria. The next time a legitimate, high-potential token is launched, you will receive an instant, actionable alert in Telegram.

Ready to understand the real power behind the strategy you just created? Let's dive into the Core Concepts.

**‚û°Ô∏è Next: [Core Concepts / What is a Strategy?](./core-concepts/what-is-a-strategy)**
Excellent. Now that the user is set up, it's time to build their foundational knowledge. This "Core Concepts" section is crucial for turning a new user into a power user. We'll explain our platform's core logic in a way that is clear, concise, and empowering.

---

### **Section 3 of 10: Core Concepts**

**(Page: What is a Strategy?)**

**Title:** ## Core Concepts: What is a Strategy?

At its heart, MemeTrader is an engine that constantly asks a simple question: "Does this token match my criteria?" A **Strategy** is simply your answer to that question. It's the set of instructions you give our engine to find the exact opportunities you're looking for.

Every strategy is built from two fundamental building blocks: **Triggers** and **Rules**.

`Trigger (When to look) + Rules (What to look for) = Action (Alert)`

Understanding how these two components work together is the key to building powerful and precise alpha engines.

**[Placeholder for a simple, elegant diagram: A funnel graphic. At the top, "Events (Millions of on-chain & off-chain events)". The funnel narrows. In the middle, "Your Triggers (e.g., 'New Token Created')". The funnel narrows further. At the bottom, "Your Rules (e.g., 'Is Not a Honeypot')". A single arrow comes out the bottom, pointing to an "Alert".]**

---
**(Page: Triggers vs. Rules: The "When" vs. The "What")**

**Title:** ### Triggers vs. Rules: The "When" vs. The "What"

It's essential to understand the difference between a Trigger and a Rule.

#### **Triggers: The "When"**

A **Trigger** is the event that tells your strategy, "Wake up and start analyzing now!" Our engine is processing millions of events per second, but your strategy will only activate when an event matches one of your chosen triggers.

*   **Event-Driven Triggers:** These fire when a *new* action happens.
    *   `A New Token is Created`
    *   `A Tweet Mentions a Token`
    *   `A Followed Dev Deploys a New Token`

*   **State-Driven Triggers:** These fire when our system's periodic scans find a token that matches a specific *state*.
    *   `A Token Matches a Screener` (e.g., finds a token that is 7 days old and just crossed a $1M market cap).

A strategy can have multiple triggers. It will run if **ANY** of its triggers are activated.

---
**(Page: Understanding Dealbreakers)**

**Title:** ### Understanding Dealbreakers

Once a trigger activates your strategy and a token is being analyzed, the first thing the engine checks is your list of **Dealbreakers**.

A Dealbreaker is a condition that **must be 100% true**. If a token fails even a single Dealbreaker, the entire evaluation process stops immediately, and no alert is sent. They are your most important safety net.

Think of them as the bouncer at the front door of your club. If a token doesn't meet these absolute, non-negotiable standards, it's not getting in.

**Common Use Case:**
Your Dealbreakers section should contain your "hard line" safety and security checks.

*   `Is Honeypot` `is` `False`
*   `Sell Tax (%)` `is less than` `25`
*   `Has Minting Authority` `is` `False`

**[Placeholder for an image: A simple flowchart. "Token Found" -> Diamond shape "Passes Dealbreakers?" -> Arrow "No" points to a red "REJECTED" box. Arrow "Yes" points to "Continue to Rule Groups".]**

---
**(Page: The Power of Rule Groups (AND/OR Logic))**

**Title:** ### The Power of Rule Groups (AND/OR Logic)

If a token passes all your Dealbreakers, it moves on to the **Rule Groups**. This is where you define the more nuanced characteristics of the gems you want to find.

Rule Groups allow you to combine multiple conditions with powerful `AND` / `OR` logic.

#### **`MATCH ALL` (AND Logic)**

When a Rule Group is set to `MATCH ALL`, the token must satisfy **every single rule** within that group. This is perfect for defining a set of conditions that must all be true.

*   **Example: "Developer Legitimacy" Group**
    *   `Contract Renounced` `is` `True`
    *   **AND** `Creator Rug History` `is` `False`
    *   **AND** `LP Locked` `is` `True`

#### **`MATCH ANY` (OR Logic)**

When a Rule Group is set to `MATCH ANY`, the token only needs to satisfy **at least one** of the rules within that group. This is ideal for situations where you're looking for one of several possible positive signals.

*   **Example: "Early Momentum" Group**
    *   `Liquidity (USD)` `is greater than` `$10,000`
    *   **OR** `Social Volume (1h)` `is greater than` `100`
    *   **OR** `Followed Wallet Holder Count` `is greater than` `0`

You can combine multiple Rule Groups in a single strategy. The token must pass Group 1 **AND** Group 2 **AND** Group 3. This multi-layered approach allows you to build incredibly precise and sophisticated alpha engines.

**‚û°Ô∏è Next: [Feature Guides / The Strategy Editor: A Deep Dive](./feature-guides/strategy-editor-deep-dive)**
Excellent. Now that the user understands the foundational concepts, it's time for the deep dive into the most important feature of the application. This section will be detailed, visual, and packed with tips to turn a user into a master strategist.

---

### **Section 4 of 10: Feature Guides**

**(Page: The Dashboard Hubs / The Strategies Page)**

**Title:** ## The Strategies Page: Your Command Center

The "Strategies" page is your central command center for managing all your alpha engines. Here, you can create, edit, activate, and, most importantly, analyze the performance of every strategy you build.

We designed this page to be more than just a list. Each strategy is presented as a **Strategy Card**, a mini-dashboard giving you at-a-glance insights into its configuration and performance.

**[Placeholder for an image: A screenshot of the full "Strategies" page, showing multiple Strategy Cards with different stats and statuses.]**

### Understanding the Strategy Card

Each card is broken down into three key sections:

1.  **Configuration Summary:** This area quickly tells you how the strategy is set up. You can see its active triggers, the number of rules, and its data handling policy without needing to open the editor.
2.  **Performance Insights (Pro Feature):** This is where you see the results. It shows you the number of alerts the strategy has triggered, its historical success rate, and its total realized P&L from the trades it found. This is the ultimate feedback loop for refining your approach.
3.  **Actions:** From here, you can quickly `Activate` or `Pause` a strategy, `Edit` its rules, or access a deeper menu to `Clone`, `Share`, or `View` its detailed performance report.

### Optimizing Your Strategies

The goal isn't just to create strategies, but to improve them. The **"Strategy Performance Report"** page, accessible from each card's action menu, is your key to optimization.

This report will show you:
*   **Winning & Losing Trades:** A clear breakdown of which trades found by the strategy were profitable.
*   **"Missed Opportunities" Analysis:** This powerful feature shows you tokens that *almost* matched your strategy but failed on one specific rule. This is the fastest way to identify if your rules are too strict and causing you to miss out on gems.

**[Placeholder for a GIF: Shows a user clicking the "..." menu on a Strategy Card, selecting "View Performance Report," and scrolling through the detailed report page.]**

---

**(Page: The Strategy Editor: A Deep Dive)**

**Title:** ### The Strategy Editor: A Deep Dive

The Strategy Editor is where you turn your market insights into an automated, 24/7 alpha-hunting machine. We've designed it as a simple 4-step wizard to guide you through the process, from initial setup to final review.

#### **Step 1: Details - Naming & Data Policy**

This is where you give your strategy a name and define its core behavior.

*   **Strategy Information:** Give your strategy a clear, descriptive name (e.g., "High-Volume Breakout Screener").
*   **Data Handling Policy:** This is a crucial advanced setting. By clicking the **`[‚öôÔ∏è Settings]`** icon, you can control how the strategy behaves when data from external APIs is temporarily unavailable.
    *   **Data Strictness (ON):** The safest setting. The strategy will wait briefly for data and will fail if any critical information (like honeypot status) can't be found.
    *   **Data Strictness (OFF):** The "Degen Mode." The strategy will proceed immediately and simply skip any rules for which data is missing. Use with caution.

**[Placeholder for an image: A screenshot of Step 1 of the wizard, with a callout box highlighting the `[‚öôÔ∏è Settings]` icon.]**

#### **Step 2: Triggers - Defining "When"**

This is where you tell the engine what events to watch for. Remember, your strategy will run if **ANY** of your selected triggers fire.

*   **Best Practice:** You can combine different trigger types. For example, you could have a strategy that runs for both `A New Token is Created` **AND** `A Token Enters Dextools Trending`, applying the same set of safety rules to both scenarios.

**[Placeholder for an image: A screenshot of Step 2, showing a user adding two different triggers to the list.]**

#### **Step 3: Rules - Defining "What"**

This is the heart of your strategy. Here, you'll define your Dealbreakers and Rule Groups.

*   **Pro Tip:** Use the **Rule Selector Drawer** to its full potential. Don't just scroll; use the **Search** and **Filters** to find the exact data point you need.
*   **Hover for Knowledge:** Not sure what "Top 10 Holder %" means? Hover over any rule in the drawer to get a detailed description and understand its impact.
*   **Building Your Logic:**
    1.  **Start with Dealbreakers:** Always define your non-negotiable safety rules first. What conditions will make you instantly reject a token?
    2.  **Use `MATCH ALL` Groups for Core Criteria:** Create `MATCH ALL` groups for sets of conditions that *must* all be true. For example, a "Developer Legitimacy" group.
    3.  **Use `MATCH ANY` Groups for Flexible Criteria:** Create `MATCH ANY` groups when you're looking for one of several possible positive signals, like in our "Early Market Health" example.

**[Placeholder for a video demo (2-3 minutes): A screen recording showing the entire process of building a strategy in Step 3. The user adds a Dealbreaker, then creates a `MATCH ALL` group, then a `MATCH ANY` group, demonstrating how to use the Rule Selector Drawer and combine different logic types.]**

#### **Step 4: Review - Confirm and Activate**

The final step. Review the complete summary of your new strategy to ensure the Triggers and Rules are configured exactly as you intended. You can also choose to activate the strategy immediately upon saving.

Once you click `Save Strategy`, your new engine is live and tirelessly scanning the market on your behalf.

**‚û°Ô∏è Next: [Feature Guides / The Discovery Hubs](./feature-guides/discovery-hubs)**
Perfect. Now that the user has mastered the Strategy Editor, let's introduce them to the proactive discovery tools. This section is all about how to find the "needles in the haystack"‚Äîthe high-potential authors, developers, and wallets that will become the inputs for their most powerful strategies.

---

### **Section 4 of 10: Feature Guides (Continued)**

**(Page: The Discovery Hubs / Tracking Authors & Lists)**

**Title:** ## The Author Hub: Curating Your Twitter Alpha

The quality of your Twitter-based strategies depends entirely on the quality of your sources. The **Author Hub** is your dedicated command center for discovering, managing, and organizing the Twitter accounts you want to monitor.

Instead of adding handles one-by-one inside the Strategy Editor, you manage a central, reusable library of authors here.

**[Placeholder for an image: A screenshot of the full "Twitter Handles" (Author Hub) page, showing a list of authors and the "Tags" sidebar.]**

### Core Features of the Author Hub

*   **Centralized Management:** See all the authors you're tracking in one place. You can quickly see their status (`Active`/`Inactive`) and add or remove them.
*   **Search & Filter:** Instantly find an author in your list.
*   **Tags for Organization:** This is the key to making your lists powerful and reusable. Instead of one giant list, you can group authors using tags. This allows you to be incredibly precise in your strategies.

### The Power of Tags: A Practical Example

Imagine you want to create two different strategies:
1.  A "degen" strategy that listens to high-risk, high-reward meme coin accounts.
2.  A "serious" strategy that listens to respected developers and analysts.

Instead of managing two separate lists of authors, you can use tags:

1.  In the Author Hub, you add `@elonmusk` and tag him as `narrative-king`.
2.  You add `@cobie` and tag him as `serious-alpha`.
3.  You add `@degen_sniper_123` and tag him as `degen-plays`.

Now, in the Strategy Editor, when you add the `A Tweet Mentions a Token` trigger, the "Select Author List" dropdown will contain your custom tags. You can tell your degen strategy to *only* listen to authors tagged with `degen-plays`, and your serious strategy to *only* listen to those tagged with `serious-alpha`.

**[Placeholder for a GIF: Shows a user in the Author Hub, adding a new tag called "VCs," and then dragging and dropping a few author names onto that tag to assign them.]**

---

**(Page: The Discovery Hubs / Tracking Wallets & Devs)**

**Title:** ### The Intelligence Hubs: Finding Proven Winners

The most powerful alpha doesn't come from what people *say* on Twitter; it comes from what they *do* on-chain. Our Intelligence Hubs are designed to help you find the wallets of proven, successful traders and developers.

#### **The Dev Network Explorer**

This is your tool for reverse-engineering success.

1.  **Start with a Winner:** Find a token that has already performed incredibly well.
2.  **Input the Address:** Paste the token's contract address into the Dev Network Explorer.
3.  **Get the Report:** Our engine performs a deep, on-chain analysis and generates a **"Developer Scorecard."**

**[Placeholder for an image: A screenshot of the Developer Scorecard page, highlighting the "Success Score," "Rug Score," and the "Insider Network" graph.]**

The Scorecard shows you everything: the dev's historical success rate, their typical launch patterns (the "Dev Profile Summary"), and, most importantly, their hidden network of associated wallets.

#### **The Alpha Wallet Explorer**

This works similarly but focuses on the *traders* who found the token early. By analyzing the transaction history of a successful token, we can identify the wallets that bought in first and made the most profit. You can then "deep dive" into their full trading history.

### The Ultimate Goal: Following the "Smart Money"

Once you've used the Discovery Hubs to identify a high-potential developer or a profitable trader's wallet, you can click the **`[+ Follow Dev]`** or **`[+ Follow Wallet]`** button.

This adds them to your personal "Followed" list, which you can manage from the **"My Developers"** page.

More importantly, it unlocks the most powerful triggers in the Strategy Editor:
*   `A Followed Dev Deploys a New Token`
*   `A Followed Wallet makes a Trade`

By curating your own private list of proven on-chain winners, you are building a proprietary alpha feed that no one else has.

**‚û°Ô∏è Next: [Feature Guides / Advanced Alerting](./feature-guides/advanced-alerting)**
Perfect. Now that users know how to build strategies and find alpha sources, let's introduce them to the advanced features that complete the trading lifecycle. This section covers the proactive "Screener," the crucial "Exit Strategies," and the intelligent "Watchlist."

---

### **Section 4 of 10: Feature Guides (Continued)**

**(Page: Advanced Alerting / The Persistent Screener)**

**Title:** ## The Persistent Screener: Hunting for Sleeping Giants

Not all opportunities happen at launch. Some of the best trades are found in tokens that have been trading for days or weeks, quietly building momentum before a major breakout. The **Persistent Screener** is your automated tool for finding these "sleeping giants."

While most triggers are **event-driven** (reacting to a *new* event), the Screener is **state-driven**. It periodically scans the entire market for tokens that currently match a specific set of criteria.

**[Placeholder for an image: A screenshot of the "Screener Hub" page, showing several user-created screeners with different schedules and filter summaries.]**

### How it Works

1.  **Build Your Filter:** In the "Screener Hub," you create a new screener. Instead of complex rules, you define a simple set of filters.
2.  **Set Your Schedule:** You decide how often you want the screener to run‚Äîfrom every 15 minutes to once a day.
3.  **Link to a Strategy:** In the Strategy Editor, you use the new `A Token Matches a Screener` trigger and select the screener you just built.

### A Powerful Use Case: The "Weekly Breakout" Screener

Imagine you want to find tokens that are more established but are showing signs of a potential breakout. You could create a screener that runs every 4 hours with these filters:

*   `Token Age (Days)` `is greater than` `7`
*   `Market Cap (USD)` `is between` `$50,000` and `$500,000`
*   `Volume (24h)` `is greater than` `$100,000`
*   `Price Change (24h %)` `is greater than` `25`

This screener will ignore the chaotic launch phase and only bring you tokens that have survived their first week and are now showing strong momentum. When it finds a match, it will then send the token to your chosen strategy for the final, deep safety and quality checks.

---

**(Page: Advanced Alerting / Exit Strategies & Position Tracking)**

**Title:** ### Exit Strategies: Plan Your Trade, Trade Your Plan

Finding a great entry is only half the battle. A successful trader knows exactly when to exit. Our **Position Tracking & Exit Strategy** features are designed to help you manage your trades with discipline and precision.

Once our system automatically detects that you've entered a trade (based on an alert we sent), that trade will appear in your new **"Positions"** dashboard. From there, you can attach a dedicated **Exit Strategy**.

**[Placeholder for a video demo: Shows the "Positions" dashboard, a user clicking `[Set Exit Strategy]` on a trade, and quickly setting up a P&L target and a Trailing Stop Loss in the simple Exit Editor.]**

An Exit Strategy is simpler than an Entry Strategy. It's a set of triggers designed to protect your profits and limit your losses.

#### Key Exit Triggers You Can Set:

*   **P&L Hits Target:** The most important trigger. `Take Profit at +200%` or `Stop Loss at -25%`. This is based on your *actual* P&L, tracked in real-time.
*   **Trailing Stop Loss (Pro Feature):** The ultimate risk management tool. Set a `15% Trailing SL`, and the system will only trigger an alert if the price drops 15% from its *highest point* since you entered. This lets your winners run while protecting you from reversals.
*   **Dev Wallet Activity:** Your safety net. This can trigger an instant exit alert if our system detects that the developer has unlocked liquidity or started dumping their tokens.

---

**(Page: Advanced Alerting / The Watchlist & Momentum Tracking)**

**Title:** ### The Watchlist: Watch, Then Pounce

Sometimes a token from an alert looks interesting, but you're not ready to invest immediately. You want to see if it develops real momentum first. The **Watchlist** is your tool for this.

1.  **Add to Watchlist:** Every entry alert you receive in Telegram has an `[üëÅÔ∏è Add to Watchlist]` button.
2.  **Set Your Momentum Strategy:** In the dashboard, you can define your single, global **"Momentum Strategy."** This is where you define what "real traction" means to you.
3.  **Get the Momentum Alert:** If a token on your watchlist meets your momentum criteria, you'll receive a new, distinct alert: `[üî• Momentum Alert]`.

#### What Makes a Good Momentum Strategy?

Momentum strategies are all about the **rate of change**. You're looking for explosive growth. Great rules for your Momentum Strategy include:

*   `Telegram Member Growth (1h)` `is greater than` `50%`
*   `Social Velocity (% Change)` `is greater than` `300%`
*   `Holder Growth (4h)` `is greater than` `100%`
*   `Message Velocity (Messages/Min)` `is greater than` `50`

The Watchlist and Momentum Tracker turn a two-step process (See Alert -> Manually Research for Hours) into a fully automated workflow, ensuring you only invest your time and capital in tokens that are proving they have real community and market traction.

#### **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

*   **Q: Is my wallet secure when I connect to MemeTrader?**
    *   **A:** Yes, 100%. We use the "Sign-In with Wallet" (SIWE) standard. This is a cryptographic signature that proves you own the wallet, but it is **not a transaction** and it **cannot** grant us any access to your funds or private keys. Your assets never leave your wallet.

*   **Q: How fast are the alerts?**
    *   **A:** Our entire backend is built on a high-speed, event-driven architecture designed for near-instant processing. For on-chain events like a new token launch, you can typically expect an alert in your Telegram within a few seconds of the event happening on the blockchain.

*   **Q: What chains do you support?**
    *   **A:** For our initial launch, we are focused on providing the best-in-class experience for the Solana ecosystem. We plan to expand to other EVM chains like Base, Ethereum, and Polygon in the near future.

*   **Q: Can I cancel my Pro subscription at any time?**
    *   **A:** Yes. You can manage your subscription directly from your settings page. If you cancel, your Pro access will continue until the end of your current billing period.

*   **Q: How does the "AI Narrative Engine" work?**
    *   **A:** Our AI engine monitors tweets from high-signal authors you select. When it detects a tweet with the potential to inspire a new memecoin narrative, it uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract key themes and keywords. Our system then watches for new tokens being created that match these AI-identified narratives and triggers your strategy accordingly.
